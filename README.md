# MIT6.092



Welcome to my self-study repository for MIT 6.092 (Introduction to Programming in Java)!

This repository is dedicated to storing all the materials, code, notes, and reflections from my journey through the MIT 6.092 course. As a **Java beginner**, my goal is to systematically learn Java programming through this course and document my progress.



## Course Overview



MIT 6.092 is a classic introductory Java programming course from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It aims to help students grasp the fundamentals of the Java language, object-oriented programming paradigms, and common data structures and algorithms.



## Repository Contents



- **`src/`**: Contains Java source code for course exercises and projects.
- **`notes/`**: Holds my notes, summaries, and key concepts learned during the study process.
- **`resources/`**: Stores supplementary materials, reference links, and other relevant resources for the course.
- **`assignments/`**: Contains solutions and thought processes for course assignments (if provided by the course).



## Learning Objectives



- Master the basic syntax and features of the Java language.
- Understand core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Become familiar with common data structures (arrays, lists, etc.) and algorithms.
- Develop the ability to independently solve programming problems.
